Here's an easy step-by-step guide on how to update an existing app on the Google Play Store:

Sign in to your Google Play Console account.

Select the app you want to update.

Click on the "Release" tab from the left-hand menu.

Choose the "Create release" button to create a new release for your app.

Select the type of release you want to create, either "Internal test," "Alpha," "Beta," or "Production."

Upload the new APK file for your app. Make sure that it has a higher version number than the previous release.

Add release notes to inform users about the changes and improvements in the new version.

Click on "Review" and make sure that all the information is correct.

Click on "Start rollout" to publish the update.

Wait for the update to be processed and published on the Google Play Store. This process may take several hours or even a few days depending on the volume of submissions and the complexity of the changes.

It's important to test the updated app thoroughly before releasing it to ensure that it works properly and does not have any issues. Additionally, make sure to communicate the changes and improvements to your users and encourage them to update to the latest version.
